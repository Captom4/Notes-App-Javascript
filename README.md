# Notes-App-Javascript
### Below are the instructions:

* Take the user stories and use them to build a frontend, single page web app.

* You can't use existing web frameworks, libraries or even a test library (e.g. no Angular, React, Jasmine, jQuery).

### Below are the user stories that guided this project:

* As a programmer,
So that I can record something I need to remember,
I can create a new note.

* As a programmer,
So that I can find the one I want,
I can see a list of my notes, where each note is abbreviated to the first 20 characters.

* As a programmer,
So that I can see all the information in the note,
I can see the full text of an individual note on its own page.
